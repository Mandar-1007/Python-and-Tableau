# Overview

Data Analysis using Tableau & Python by visualizing the data using Maps, Graphs and Charts to derive insights and support decision making through the resulting dashboards. The Python script was written in the Spyder IDE. The repository consists of three projects as mentioned below

• Sales Analysis for "Value Inc"

• "Blue Bank" Loan Analysis

• "BlogMe" Sentiment and Keyword Analysis

The data being used for the first project is in .csv format whereas it is in .json and .xlsx formats for the second & third project's respectively

# Packages/Libraries used

• json         - to work with json data

• pandas       - to work with data sets

• numpy        - for numerical operations on large quantities of data

• matplotlib   - Python visualization library

• vader        - provides sentiment scores based on the words used


# Why data visualization is important

With so much information being collected through data analysis in the current landscape today, we need a way to paint a picture of the data so that we can just interpret it a bit more easier and data visualization gives us a clear way on what the information means. It gives us a better context through charts, graphs, maps, etc and makes the data more natural for the human mind to understand. Consequently, it is easier for us to have a look at the data visualizations, understand the trends, patterns and outliers. This comes into play specifically with very large data sets because when one is looking at a small dataset, maybe 1000 rows or so, it's easy to just look at a spreadsheet or a table and understand what's wrong and what's right. However, when we move on to 100,000 rows or 100 million rows, that's when the issue comes in where one needs data visualization, because its hard to look at the dataset to understand the insights. Data visualization takes the data, models it and delivers it so that conclusions can be reached by the people reading it. Now, the people who read the dashboards can be yourself, but it can be other stakeholders as well. Tools like Tableau help reveal the patterns and trends hiding beneath the surface, especially with really complex data, with a large amount of rows and lots of calculations.
It also enables companies and stakeholders to present data driven insights and findings so that everyone can understand. Stakeholders can be your leadership, team management or any stakeholder that needs to take swift action with minimal expenditure of time. A dashboard outlining any insights of the business becomes important in the corporate world

Here are some benefits of data visualization

• Helps to better absorb business information by enabling easy ingestion or understanding of large amounts of business data

• Visually stimulating to promote quick decison making by uncovering not so obvious trends and patterns

• Quick access to important metrics and helps to optimize business processes

• Helps to align dashboards to company's goals, business objectives and track key performance indicators (KPIs)
