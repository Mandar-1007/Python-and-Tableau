# Overview

Data Analysis using Tableau & Python by visualizing the data using Maps, Graphs and Charts to derive insights and support decision making through the resulting dashboards. The Python script was written in the Spyder IDE. The repository consists of three projects as mentioned below

• Sales Analysis for "Value Inc"

• "Blue Bank" Loan Analysis

• "BlogMe" Sentiment and Keyword Analysis

The data being used for the first project is in .csv format whereas it is in .json and .xlsx formats for the second & third project's respectively

# Packages/Libraries used

• json         - to work with json data

• pandas       - to work with data sets

• numpy        - for numerical operations on large quantities of data

• matplotlib   - Python visualization library

• vader        - provides sentiment scores based on the words used


# Why data visualization is important

Data visualization simplifies complex data, making it easier to interpret through charts, graphs, and maps. While small datasets can be reviewed manually, large datasets require visualization to reveal trends, patterns, and outliers. It enables stakeholders, from analysts to executives, to quickly grasp insights and make data-driven decisions. Tools like Tableau help uncover hidden patterns, presenting clear, actionable insights efficiently

Here are some benefits of data visualization

• Helps to better absorb business information by enabling easy ingestion or understanding of large amounts of business data

• Visually stimulating to promote quick decison making by uncovering not so obvious trends and patterns

• Quick access to important metrics and helps to optimize business processes

• Helps to align dashboards to company's goals, business objectives and track key performance indicators (KPIs)
